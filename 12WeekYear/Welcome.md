This is a sample vault that shows how I keep track of the 12 week year

# Step 1
Create your goals and think about what you want to do each week to make them happen.
Here are the two sample goals I used with assigned tactics:
## Goal 1: Work out regulary
Tactic 1: Go to the gym 3x per week
Tactic 2: Go for a walk 2x per week

## Goal 2: Keep a clean home
Tactic 1: Vaccum whole appartment once per week
Tactic 2: Mop the floors once per week
Tactic 3: Change sheets once per week

# Step 2
Create your weekly schedule and distribute all your tactics to the different days of the week. Tag each task for goal 1 with #12wyg1 and each task for goal 2 with #12wyg2 and so on. Check out the [[daily]] template, where I have laid out a typical week for myself. The daily pages with the correct tasks for the day are then created by the template.

This solution only works with daily pages and not with tasks on the weekly page.

# Step 3
Check out the [[weekly]] template. Adjust the start date of your 12 week year (`twystart`) and the number of goals that you have (`goals`)
